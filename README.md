# Haskell Compilation Error: Undefined function 'sort'

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: forgetting to import necessary modules.
The `bug.hs` file contains code that attempts to use the `sort` function from the `Data.List` module without importing it. This results in a compilation error.

The `bugSolution.hs` file provides the corrected code, demonstrating the importance of explicit imports.
